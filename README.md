A live map for Ark: Survival Evolved to view your tames, heatmap of wild dinos, and search tools.

## Planned Features
* Ability to search for tribe dinos
* "Admin mode" to show all dinos
* Fancier UI

## Setup
* To set up your own Ark Web Map, you'll need to clone this repo and grab my [Ark Save Manager](https://github.com/Roman-Port/Ark-Save-Manager) project, as it is required to use this map. 
* Next, you'll need to obtain your own map images __until I get permission to redistribute map images from allgamemaps.com__.
* A configuration file is coming soon. Instructions will be updated once that change comes aroud.
